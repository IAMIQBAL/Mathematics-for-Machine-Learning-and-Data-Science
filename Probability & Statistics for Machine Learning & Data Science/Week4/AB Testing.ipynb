    "With the ability to calculate the t-statistic now you need a way to determine if you should reject (or not) the null hypothesis. Complete the `reject_nh_t_statistic` function below. This function should return whether to reject (or not) the null hypothesis by using the p-value method given the value of the t-statistic, the degrees of freedom and a level of significance. **This should be a two-sided test.**\n",

You can use the fact that the `CDF` of a distribution provides the probability of getting a value as extreme or less extreme than the one provided, so the p-value can be computed as `1 - CDF(current_value)`. If you are conducting a two-sided test, you must use the absolute value of the current value since the \"extreme\" condition can be attained by either side. In this case you must also multiply said probability by 2 so you can compare against $\\alpha$ rather than against $\\frac{\\alpha}{2}$.\n",
